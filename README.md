## Project Description

This is a game that I'm working on for an upcoming college project. The main idea is to have a random maze generator and have the player go through generated mazes to progress in the game's narrative. I also plan to do some weekly devlogs regarding the development of the game and incorporate feedback (if I receive any) into it.

## How can I play?

If you're on Windows, simply go to the releases folder, find your .exe, download it and run. Getting the latest version is recommended.

If you're on Linux or MacOs, I have no idea of how things work on them, but there's an available release for them too. If you're not a new user, you probably know how to get them to work.
