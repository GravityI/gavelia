#Kilvault Project Guidelines

Kilvault Project Goals
----------------------
- Force myself to learn new skills, specially about documentation, marketing and polishing.
- Get some visibility
- Having fun during development
- Get a good grade on the applicable subjects.
- Being proud of my game

Kilvault Game Design
--------------------

**Confirmed**
- Procedurally Generated Levels
- First Person Shooter Mechanics
- Throwable Weapon
- Safe rooms between each level

**Maybe?** (Time constraints or not fitting in the concept as a whole)
- Weapon is a Disc
- Enemies that throw Disc
- Disc Catching
- Barrier/Shield
- Narrator guiding the player

Kilvault Narrative Guidelines
-----------------------------

**Confirmed**
- Sci-fi World
- Narrator
- Sports/Reality Show setting with a Scientific/Corporate subtheme

**Maybe?** (Same as design constraints)
- Branching narrative

Kilvault Marketing Strategy
---------------------------

**Confirmed**
- Try to get an initial audience between friends and family
- Twitter posts regarding development techniques
- Video Devlogs posted on YouTube
- Showing off on Discord channels
- Constant GitHub and Trello updates to maintain public interest

**Maybe?** (Time constraints or lack of interest)
- Written Devlogs
- Videos explaining the implementation of certain gameplay elements
- Videos containing my references for each area of development and a short explanation of each
- 1 minute unedited summaries showing off what I've been doing each week

Kilvault Publishing Strategy
----------------------------

The initial plan is to release the game on Itch.io and, if I'm satisfied with the project and manage to get coverage for the costs involved, release on Steam or some other marketplaces. In case the project results much better than expected, I will consider talking to a publisher in order to tackle visibility, publishing and possibly expansion issues in a more appropriate manner.

That being said, my immediate priority is getting good grades this semester and having good marketing/publishing is not going to help me, so I'm willing to sacrifice them first if needed.
